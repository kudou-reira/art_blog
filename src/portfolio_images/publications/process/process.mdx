The RF-Net code was written use PyTorch, so I set out to manipulate the descriptors's convolutional networks in their inherited model file. I used the groups parameter to rewrite portions of the code to transform normal convolutional layers into depthwise-separable layers. After each incremental change, I would run experiments of that modified detector on [ABCI](https://abci.ai/) servers as my company had an agreement with them.

Thus, by observing the trends of optimizing certain layers, I found that transforming normal convolutional layers for orientation into lightweight ones actually increased the computational load in FLOPS (floating point operations per second). After exhaustive experiments on decreasing computational load in addition to bonus experiments on trying to benchmark our new lightweight layers, we had enough data to submit a manuscript as well.
