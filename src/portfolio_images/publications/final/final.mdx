Experiments conducted with the advice of my research and development manager, [Dr. Atsunori Kanemura](https://sites.google.com/site/atsukan82/), led to the writing of a manuscript named "Designing Lightweight Feature Descriptor Networks with Depthwise Separable Convoution". This paper was eventually submitted to and accepted by JSAI 2020 for the international session under the [machine learning: image classification section](https://confit.atlas.jp/guide/event/jsai2020/session/2K01-05/advanced). 

After the conference, my manuscript was fortunately selected as one of the top papers of the conference. As such, I was invited to contribute to JSAI 2020's post-proceedings by further extending my already accepted manuscript. This post-proceedings paper was eventually published in the Springer Nature series Advances in Intelligent Systems and Computing in the category "Advances in Artificial Intelligence" with the subtitle of "Selected Papers from the Annual Conference of Japanese Society of Artificial Intelligence (JSAI 2020)".

The extended manuscript can be found [here](https://github.com/kudou-reira/portfolio/blob/master/src/portfolio_images/publications/final/images/Yeo_Feature_Descriptors_Extended_JSAI2020_Proceedings.pdf).

JSAI 2020 was held online this year due to the COVID-19 pandemic. My presentation video is not available to me, but a sample rehearsal presentation that I gave at an all-hands meeting at LeapMind is embedded below.
