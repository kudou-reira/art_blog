During my time at LeapMind Inc. (Tokyo, Japan) as a machine learning engineer, I worked on an in-house survey of lightweight feature descriptors.

LeapMind has a contract with AIST (National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology), and continues discussion with JAXA (Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency). The inquiries from these institutions was whether it was possible to bring edge deep learning technologies onto satellites. In the case of Mr. Ishida of JAXA, determining a landing position for a satellite orbiting the moons of Mars was a hypothetical situation he was interested in.

For both of these projects, a common theme was extracting features and their corresponding descriptors from images.
