I used to strictly work only in graphic design and 2D illustrations/sketching. Only after getting very deep in CGI art did I realize that there are quite a few overlapping elements between 2D and 3D.

For example, concept artists have begun to use photobashing elements in tandem with 3D scene setup to help them with their first pass concepts that are shown to art directors for feedback. Additionally, very rarely are 3D renders delivered as the final product. Different render layers are composited together in external applications such as Photoshop to achieve the final desired effect.

These were the main impetuses behind me returning to 2D practice and paintings.
