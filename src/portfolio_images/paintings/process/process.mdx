My preferred tool if Adobe Photoshop. I used to create graphic blockouts (visible in WIP gallery) before fleshing out a general sketch.

Nowadays, I prefer to sketch my scene in 3D, then take it as far as possible. After that, I'll render out an image as a shot that serves as the plate upon which I'll composite/paint further upon on. If I need additional elements, I'll either photobash them in, or paint them in using a texture brush. I've also started to color grade my paintings in Adobe Lightroom for finishing touches.
