I drew the chibi and his bag in Adobe Photoshop. Then, I exported both layers to Adobe Illustrator where I used the image trace function to convert my drawing to a vector. I also created a small dust cloud using the image trace ability in Adobe Illustrator.

From Illustrator, I exported these assets to After Effects where I animated all the parts. Afterwards, I animated test of my online handle.
