After finishing my figure sculpting studies, I had a naked mesh that didn't have any color or details. In order to develop a character from my base mesh, I needed to add details to the skin such as pores, freckles, subsurface veins, and color. I also needed to texture eyes, the surrounding tear meniscus of the eyes, and eyebrows and eyelashes. Lastly, I needed to create hair meshes as well as custom hair textures.
