This is a project that builds upon a previous project, [human figure sculpting](https://kudou-reira.github.io/portfolio/#/figure_sculpting). It mostly focuses on texturing human skin and facial features. I had planned on creating an entire textured character, but settled for portraiture as a first pass.

**Tools used**: ZBrush 2020, Autodesk Maya 2020, Marvelous Designer 9.0, Mari 4.6, Substance Painter 2020, Marmoset Renderer 3.0, Adobe Lightroom
