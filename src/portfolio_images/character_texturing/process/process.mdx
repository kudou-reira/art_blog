Since the human skin is very complex, I decided to start with that aspect first before moving on to other portions of the face.

I took the highest subdivision model of my figure sculpt from ZBrush, and imported it into Maya. There, I created a UDIM (multiple UV islands) set. The purpose of this was to use The Foundry's Mari to project paint bump maps onto my model. Mari only supports UDIMs format, so I had no choice but to follow this workflow.

Once the bump maps were applied, I exported the UDIMs from Mari to ZBrush, then assigned layers at the highest subdivision level for each bump map (I had 3 displacement maps). Then, I tuned the amount of each layer until I was satisfied with the skin displacement.

Afterwards, I decimated by highest subdivision model, then bake texture maps (ex. normal, ambient occlusion) onto my retopologized model. I took these into Substance Painter and started to procedurally put down base skin color, freckles, and veins. I also did the same for the eyes, and baked a concave tear duct onto a convex tear meniscus strip.

As for the hair and eyebrows/eyelashes, I started with xgen in Maya to make the default hair textures. I created 5 base long hair textures and 2 short stray hairs. The hair card meshes themselves were generated by Ornatrix, and then hand-placed accordingly. Using the same methods to generate the hair textures, I used xgen to produce the eyebrows and eyelashes. However, this time, I used the convert to mesh option to get individual mesh objects with matching UVs across the board.

Lastly, I created some basic clothing in Marvelous Designer to accompany the model in the final render.
