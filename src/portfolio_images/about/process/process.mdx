If I could sum up my personal philosophy, it would start and end with obsession. If I'm completely enthralled by a topic, I can tolerate any kind of hardship because I need to know more.

I've always been interested in learning various skills. I believe that versatility is a must for synthesizing new, creative ideas. However, the ability to make fantastical things a reality is paramount as well. The dreamer must be able to harmonize with the realist.

It's the reason why I love art in all its mediums and why I also enjoy technology. I started my studies in the biomedical sciences, detoured to Japanese language studies, and now I'm employed as a machine learning engineer/researcher...all because I wanted to become an illustrator in Japan.

As long as I have the fire to pursue whatever that interests me, I know I will succeed. The obsession I have will make everything fall into place even if I have no foreseeable plan. All that matters is the dream.

Because of this, I believe that the first best teacher you can ever have is nature itself, and the second best teach you can ever have is yourself. Consequently, I have to invest in myself, and the best way to do that is to follow my interests.
