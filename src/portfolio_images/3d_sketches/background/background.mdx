Every morning after my daily exercise, I will do 2D sketches in photoshop of various subject matter for roughly an hour and half. Sometimes, I will study by drawing faces or figures. Other times, I will paint environments or lay out hard surface designs. The practice sessions are an integral part for maintaining and improving my foundational skills.

As a result, I decided that I also needed to keep the same mindset for my 3D CGI skills as well. As such, I also try to spend about an hour every day to work on anything CGI. This could be modeling gemotry, texturing, animating, rigging, or rendering anything.

The goal of 2D/3D sketching is to make myself "flow-ready". If I suddenly gain insight during my practice sessions, then I would want to continue to flesh out the ideas using whatever tools I'm used to. If I have a wide range of tools that I'm familiar and comfortable with, it's easier for me to translate those ideas into reality.
