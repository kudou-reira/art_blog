This page is a collection of small projects, or "mini-projects", with screenshots in the work in progress library below. Very rarely do I take an entire 3D model from start to finish. Most of them remain 3D "sketches" that may serve as inspirational elements, design accents, or motifs in later works.

**Tools used**: ZBrush 2020, Autodesk Maya 2020, Blender 2.83, Marmoset Renderer 3.0, Substance Painter 2020, Keyshot 9, 3DCoat
