I'm a heavy believer in "project-based" learning, which means that I spend only a small amount of time to understand the bare minimum of my tool(s) of choice. Once I can maneuver around comfortably, I push myself to create something as soon as possible. This ensures that I will run into a significant amount of roadblocks that double as skill checkpoints.

In this project, I wanted to use [Marvelous Designer](https://www.marvelousdesigner.com/), a powerful cloth creation/simulation suite, and [Substance Designer](https://www.substance3d.com/products/substance-designer/), a procedural material creation software.
