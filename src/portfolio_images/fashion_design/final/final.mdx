In addition, this is a final render view exported from Marmoset Renderer's viewer. The textures are in 4K. The window can be manipulated by:

**left-click drag**: **rotation**,
**right-click drag**: **pan**,
**scroll-wheel**: **zoom**

<div>{React.cloneElement(props.MarmosetViewer, { mview: view })}</div>
