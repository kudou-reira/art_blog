I created the octopus tentacle starting from a single segment of a tentacle with four suckers. These were then imported into another subgraph that would build a portion of a tentacle. These portions would then be compiled to form a single tentacle.

Multiple subgraphs of whole tentacles were then combined in a final graph. These flat textures were then applied to flat planes in Unreal Engine, and vertex painted into the floor as well for blending.
