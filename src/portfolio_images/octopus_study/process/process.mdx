I start off my 3D sketches in either Zbrush or 3DCoat, which is like 3D Adobe Photoshop. Recently, I've begun to favor Blender as well due to it having a revamped sculpting suite. This makes it so that I can quickly lay out basic shapes, then sculpt on them while trying to keep the number of faces very low poly. Once I'm satisfied with the general idea, I will begin to start the detailing phase.
