This 3D project has been on-going for quite a while. It has taken about two years from start to finish as I continuously stop and re-start progress on it. As I have been living in Tokyo for the last four years, I was inspired by Odaiba's iconic Gundam in front of Diver City shopping center. However, a common style trend in Japanese mechanoid designs is that most of them consist of heavy armor plates with an occluded core. Since I have also been studying human anatomy and sculpting as well, I wanted to integrate a more human, lightweight shape language (i.e. skeletal frames, organic muscles) into my own mech design.
