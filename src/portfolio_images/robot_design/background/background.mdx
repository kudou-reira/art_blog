When I first set out on this project, I knew that I wanted to make some kind of Eastern-themed piece. My original idea was that of a fox spirit guarding a shrine, but modernized with technology. In addition, I wanted to add muscle meshes to introduce a more organic type of machine.

As such, most of the geometry in the fox guardian robot are inspired by my anatomy studies. Behind the fox mask is a human skull that I sculpted during one such study. The muscles more or less follow the structure found in humans, and the armor pieces either serve as skin or bones.
