To conceive the general shape of the robot, I went into ZBrush and quickly sculpted out a general form at a low dynamesh level. Once that was completed, I decimated that dynamesh into a very lightweight .obj file, then took it into Maya. The inner skeletal frames were created with a NURBS/CAD software named [MOI3D](http://moi3d.com/). Once the general frame shapes were created in MOI3D, I exported them to Maya. These skeletal frames became the structural basis upon which I started to craft out armor plates which would layer upon the frames. Once the armor was more or less in place, I started on putting together a series of mesh muscles that would then intertwine with the skeletal frames and armor in order to give the robot a bit more human-like form.
