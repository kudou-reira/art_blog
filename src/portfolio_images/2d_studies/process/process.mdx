I do most of my sketching in either Adobe Photoshop or Procreate on the iPad.

If I'm doing a study of a human figure, I usually set up a picture of a human model on the side, and try to reproduce what I see on my own digital canvas. If I'm studying from an anatomy book, I draw and label the muscles I see.

Once in a while, I try to draw the underlying bone structures to really test my understanding.
