import ReactPlayer from 'react-player'
import videoURL from './images/anicharts_demo.mp4';

The final output is an Electron application that should supposedly run on all platforms (ex. Windows, Mac, Linux). I don't have a Mac, so I've only packed it for my default OS, Windows. I've also included a short demo video that shows how to use its basic functionality.

<ReactPlayer 
    url={videoURL} 
    controls={true}
/>

<div>{props.ImageGallery}</div>
