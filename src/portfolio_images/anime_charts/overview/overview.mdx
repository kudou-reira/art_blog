This was one of my personal projects that I put together when I was still self-teaching myself software development and engineering. I had worked on it on and off even after I was hired at LeapMind. It is an application that displays the current airing anime season's schedules with a short description of each show. I added various features such as sorting by popularity, rating, and time until the next episode airing. The repository for it can be found here: [anime charts](https://github.com/kudou-reira/xdccReact). The download for the Windows application is [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1QhIsPqbhEQzqp4bX2LOd8d_1zMeiwx2P/view?usp=sharing).
