One of the popular services that inspired this project is called [AniCharts](https://anichart.net/). It shows currently airing Japanese animation shows with airing dates and short blurbs detailing what the show is roughly about.

At the time, I realized that there was a common trend in the software world. Most companies were concerned with scaling their technologies across the Internet, and the language that runs on all browsers is Javascript. As a result, expertise with Javascript was most likely a must-have skill for a potential software engineer.

Since I believe in project-based learning, I wanted to try replicating and tweaking AniCharts for my own personal use. Rather than relying on a web-based application, I wanted to try compiling a desktop application that ran using Javascript as opposed to something like Java or C#. So, I ended up using Electron powered by React.

Furthermore, I saw that AniCharts offered a [GraphQL API](https://github.com/AniList/ApiV2-GraphQL-Docs). I had heard of GraphQL (a a Facebook creation) growing in popularity at the time, but never had the chance to try it out. As it supposedly handled larger queries better when compared with those of RESTful type structures, I thought that it would be a nice personal project for me to get familiar with soon-to-be common architectures.
