Rather than start off sculpting the entire figure, I started sculpting each section of the body in ZBrush. Each body part would constitute its own fragment.

In the WIP gallery, I have included multiple views of each body part I observed and sculpted. My reference images were mostly nude figures, and my primary anatomy resource was the book [Anatomy for Sculptors](https://books.google.co.jp/books/about/Anatomy_for_Sculptors.html?id=qQv4oAEACAAJ&source=kp_book_description&redir_esc=y) by Uldis and Kondrats.

My final figure was sculpted from a base mesh that I modeled in Maya, then imported into ZBrush. I also rigged it in Maya and Blender, and it has become my go-to stock figure for various softwares such as Marvelous Designer.
