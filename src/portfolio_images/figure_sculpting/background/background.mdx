The desire to start sculpting digitally was because I was really interested in CGI graphics such as Battle Angel Alita and Ghost in the Shell. Understanding the human form as second nature is the fundamental basis upon which fantastical humanoid forms can be imagined. Before learning 3D, I had only drawn and studied how to render 3D forms in two dimensions. Properly sculpting an extra dimension was absolutely necessary if I wanted to become a more well-rounded artist.
