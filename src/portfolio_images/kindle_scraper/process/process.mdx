When I was first playing around with Kindle, I wondered how I would extract information from a Kindle Notebook. After tinkering around for a while, I discovered that one could export or download one's Kindle Notes and Highlights with their "export as HTML" option.

Once that was done, I looked through the HTML file of a sample export of highlights. The words that were highlighted alternated between document division tags containing the word "highlight" and those without. Using Java's jsoup library, I [scraped](https://github.com/kudou-reira/kindleScraper/blob/master/src/com/kudoureira/htmlKindle/HTMLScrape.java) the notebook export HTML file by limiting my search to only Japanese characters (hiragana, katakana, Kanji).

This way, I was able to gather all of the words that I had highlighted. Afterwards, I made [queries](https://github.com/kudou-reira/kindleScraper/blob/master/src/com/kudoureira/dictionary/Search.java) to the Jisho API, and recorded all of the dictionary information in temporary JSON. Once all the words were finished processing, I sent it to a Python Flask server to compile all the queried information in an easily viewed .csv file (i.e. [example csv file output](https://github.com/kudou-reira/jishoServer/blob/master/outputCSV/%E5%A4%A9%E7%90%83%E9%A7%86%E3%81%91%E3%82%8B%E3%82%B9%E3%83%97%E3%83%BC%E3%83%88%E3%83%8B%E3%82%AF%E3%80%80%E6%9C%AA%E5%88%B0%E3%81%AE%E7%A9%BA%E5%BE%80%E3%81%8F%E9%81%8B%E9%80%81%E5%B1%8B%E3%80%81%E3%83%8D%E3%82%B8%E3%81%AE%E5%A4%96%E3%82%8C%E3%81%9F%E9%8A%80%E9%AB%AA%E8%A1%9B%E7%B2%BE%20(NOVEL%200)%20(Japanese%20Edition)(%E3%83%84%E3%82%AB%E3%82%B5).csv))
