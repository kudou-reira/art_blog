Since I have been living in Tokyo, Japan since the spring of 2016, I've achieved a decent level of Japanese fluency. Due to immersion, most of my entertainment (books, news, etc.) is in Japanese. During my commute and leisure time, I read Japanese novels using the Kindle application. This is an application that scans my Kindle notebooks for highlights, and then translates those kanji vocabularay into English.
