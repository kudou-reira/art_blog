This application is split into two parts. One is a [Java application](https://github.com/kudou-reira/kindleScraper) that handles scraping of Kindle notebooks. The other is a [Python flask server](https://github.com/kudou-reira/jishoServer) that receives a JSON from the Java side, and parses the information into a tidy .csv file.
