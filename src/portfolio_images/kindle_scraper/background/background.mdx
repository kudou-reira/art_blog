One of the shortcomings I came across when using the Kindle application to read Japanese novels was the fact that highlighted words in the book were not translated. If one holds and hovers over a set of Japanese Kanji/hiragana/katakana, a Japanese-English dictionary translation will pop up (if applicable). However, if the scanned words are saved as a highlight, no translation is saved along with it. It has to be added manually in the "notes" section of the highlight.

So, the idea of reducing my frustration of searching online Japanese dictionaries phrase by phrase gave birth to this personal project. I wanted to primarily use Java as I hadn't used it since I was in my undergraduate studies, and I wanted to update my skills in case I wanted to do some future mobile application development with Kotlin (similar to Java).
