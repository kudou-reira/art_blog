This is a project that I worked on for a hackathon at LeapMind. I decided to implement the paper [A Neural Algorithm of Artistic Style](https://arxiv.org/abs/1508.06576), and also make it into a user-friendly application where anyone could try it out. The repository for this project is here: [Style Transfer](https://github.com/kudou-reira/stylish).
