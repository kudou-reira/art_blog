The main idea behind this project was to implement neural style transfer from one image to another image. For example, in the original paper, the authors take the properties of Van Gogh's "Starry Night" and apply it to a stock image of houses.

My application used the core of my previous project ([Semantic Segmentation](https://kudou-reira.github.io/portfolio/#/segmentation)). A user would be able to upload two images, one with the desired style and one that will receive the style reconstructions. After finalizing the submission of the images, the python Flask server would run TensorFlow code to process the images. The implementation of the authors' paper was done in TensorFlow's higher level wrapper, Keras. That portion of the code can be found [here](https://github.com/kudou-reira/stylish/blob/master/celery-queue/classes/neural_style.py).
