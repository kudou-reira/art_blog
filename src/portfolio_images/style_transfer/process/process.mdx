I used the same structure of my previous semantic segmentation project. However, I replaced the machine learning portion with my own implementation of neural style transfer using Keras and a pretrained model of VGG-16. As it was a hackathon, I had to make use of the available resources (pre-trained models) instead of training from scratch. Rewriting TensorFlow code in Keras format was good practice as TensorFlow 2.0 has switched to Keras as a wrapper.
