This single page application was created in order to house recent projects I've completed over the past 2-3 years. They range from software engineering and machine learning applications to 3D models/sculptures and 2D paintings.

I chose to use React to power this site because of its speed (virtual DOM manipulation) and documented Github Pages support. Each link on this site follows a template format that I've setup in advance: overview, final project output, background information about the project, a general process of how the project was created, and a WIP gallery (screenshots of development).
