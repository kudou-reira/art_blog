I started off whiteboxing out various structures in Blender until I settled upon a layout I liked. Once that was finished, I started sculpting three angels which would be placed in the exedra.

Once I had decided upon the sculpture poses, I went back and sculpted the complex geometry (inner domes, windows, arches, columns) in 3DCoat and ZBrush. The nave structures are all simple geometry with textures created in Substance Designer. The rock that the angels are standing on was created procedurally in Houdini FX.

I created four unique textures (column wrap-around, Renaissance arch, marble floor spade, and the window panes). These were all UV-unwrapped flat planes/cylinders with opacity/displacement maps to simulate realism.
