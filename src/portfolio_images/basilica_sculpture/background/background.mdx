After coming back from traveling Europe multiple times, I had an idea of modeling a basilica and placing some of my own digital sculptures within it. I was inspired by the Winged Victory of Samothrace at the Louvre in France as well as the Basilica of Santa Maria Novella (Florence, Italy) and the Basilique Sainte-Marie-Madeleine de VÃ©zelay (Burgundy, France).
