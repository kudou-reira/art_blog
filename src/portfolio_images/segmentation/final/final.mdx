The final deliverable of this project was full blown (front-end, back-end, database, machine learning) in-house application that would perform a type of segmentation. As it was an in-house project, I can't speak too much about the particular details. Users would be able to upload an image to a single page application that I set up. There, people could change the hyperparameters they wanted for the segmentation.

When they were happy with their selection, they would upload it to a back-end server which would do the inference on their image. Once it was done, they would receive an email from my email address giving their page with all their segmentations over a time period. There, they would rate their segmentation as well as give feedback. 

This project was one of the first projects I undertook in the company that made a large impact, and resulted in my first promotion. Preview screenshots can be found below in the WIP gallery.
